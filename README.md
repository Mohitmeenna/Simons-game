# Simple Simon Game

This is a basic implementation of the Simon game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The Simon game challenges players to remember and reproduce sequences of colors. Each round, a new color is added to the sequence, increasing the difficulty. If the player fails to reproduce the sequence correctly, the game asks them to restart from the beginning.

- The current level is displayed at the top of the screen.

## Play the game

- Watch the sequence of colors displayed.
- Repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons.
- Each round, a new color is added to the sequence.
